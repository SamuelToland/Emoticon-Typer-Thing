# Emoticon-Typer-Thing
### What is it?
A small Python script that will allow the user to type a command (e.g. "\shrug") and have it replaced with a result (e.g. "¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯")

### How it roughly works
It listens to keys being pressed, when the prefix is pressed it will start to log all the following keys that can be used for a command, when it sees space or enter it will then lookup the command, remove the command and prefix, and enter in the result, then forget and reset

### Why did I make this?
I was bored when looking at Discord's "/shrug" command and thought it would be cool to have that in other messaging apps so took a language I somewhat knew and started messing around
